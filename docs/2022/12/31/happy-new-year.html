As someone who grew up in a Russian family, it has been challenging to witness the events of this year.</p><p>Over the past few years, I have come to appreciate the benefits of being fluent in two very different cultures: Western and Eastern European. However, it has not always been easy to navigate these dual identities. I can easily pass as either Belgian or Russian, but often feel like I don’t fully belong to either. I imagine this is a common experience for children of immigrants.</p><p>In 2014, a revolution in Ukraine resulted in the overthrow of their Russian-backed president. I was a university student at the time and I recall watching the news in awe while sitting in the Arenberg library (I should have been studying). I believe that this was the first time I developed an interest in Ukraine as a country and culture.</p><p>After graduating from university, one of my best friends embarked on a round-the-world trip. The final leg of this trip involved taking the Trans-Siberian Express from Mongolia to Moscow. When he arrived, I called him up and suggested we meet up in Kyiv. I was interested in visiting the city and this was a good opportunity as any. As some of my friends can attest, I fell completely in love with Kyiv after this trip and even considered moving there for a while. I think the reason for this sudden infatuation was that I finally felt a sense of belonging: Ukraine is both free and culturally a hybrid of East and West.</p><p>Suffice to say this war has been a small personal tragedy for me. I already had little hope for Russia to develop in the direction that I wish it would. But now they were invading and bombing the only place that I could still feel home. Nevertheless, one positive aspect of this year that I would like to highlight is the inspiring bravery of the Ukrainian people and the way that the forces of good can come together to oppose evil.</p><p>So as this year draws to a close: I would like to wish for a successful conclusion to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom. I’m sad it will have to come at such a cost, but will continue to do everything that is in my capabilities to help them, and hope you will <a href="https://www.help99.co/">too</a>. :)</p></article></main><hr><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> © 2019 Maksim Drachov / <a href="https://twitter.com/maksimdrachov">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://github.com/maksimdrachov">Github</a> </small></footer></body></html>
