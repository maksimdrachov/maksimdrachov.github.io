This past year has been unlike any other, it feels fitting to draw some conclusions and express some hopes for the future. As someone who grew up in a Russian family, it has been challenging to witness the events of this year. 

Over the past few years, I have come to appreciate the benefits of being fluent in two very different cultures: Western and Eastern European. However, it has not always been easy to navigate these dual identities. I can easily pass as either Belgian or Russian, but often feel like I don't fully belong to either. I imagine this is a common experience for children of immigrants. 

In 2014, a revolution in Ukraine resulted in the overthrow of their Russian-backed president. I was a university student at the time and I recall watching the news in awe while sitting in the Arenberg library (I should have been studying). I believe that this was the first time I developed an interest in Ukraine as a country and culture.

After graduating from university, one of my best friends embarked on a round-the-world trip. The final leg of this trip involved taking the Trans-Siberian Express from Mongolia to Moscow. When he arrived, I called him up and suggested we meet up in Kyiv. I was interested in visiting the city and this was a good opportunity as any. As some of my friends can attest, I fell completely in love with Kyiv after this trip and even considered moving there for a while. I think the reason for this sudden infatuation was that I finally felt a sense of belonging: Ukraine is both free and culturally a hybrid of East and West. 

Suffice to say this war has been a small personal tragedy for me. I already had little hope for Russia to develop in the direction that I wish it would. But now they were invading and bombing the only place that I could still feel home. Nevertheless, one positive aspect of this year that I would like to highlight is the inspiring bravery of the Ukrainian people and the way that the forces of good can come together to oppose evil.

So as this year draws to a close: I would like to wish for a successful conclusion to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom. I'm sad it will have to come at such a cost, but will continue to do everything that is in my capabilities to help them, and hope you will [too](https://www.help99.co/). :)
