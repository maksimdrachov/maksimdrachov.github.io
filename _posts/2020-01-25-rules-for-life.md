Look for meaning, cynics will try to convince you there is none, however I think there is.

Stop caring about other peoples opinion of you. Stop trying to convince everyone that you’re a good/interesting person.

If someone is dishonest towards another person, it’s a matter of time before he or she will do the same thing to you.

Don’t be afraid to spend time by yourself, 98% will be boredom, however sometimes (2%) you will get an awesome idea that wouldn’t have come to you otherwise.

If no one believes in your idea or vision, don’t be afraid to press forward by yourself.

Give emotional support to your friends if they need it: take a long walk together, let them vent about their problems, give them your perspective,…

Reading a good book can be one of the best forms of therapy: it’s helpful to realise you’re not the only one facing some kind of problem.

Don’t lie.

Avoid fake people.

Everyone has a faith/religion, if you think you don’t have one, think again. Ask yourself: what is the driving force behind my actions? Seeking pleasure? Money? Recognition from my peers or parents?

Try to build a community of like-minded people around yourself.

A large social circle can be draining and a waste of time; 3-5 good friends are usually more than enough.

Don’t give in to peer pressure.
