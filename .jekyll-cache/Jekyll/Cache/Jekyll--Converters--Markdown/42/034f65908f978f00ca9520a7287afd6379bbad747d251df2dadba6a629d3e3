I"Š<p>Look for meaning, cynics will try to convince you there is none, however I think there is.</p>

<p>Stop caring about other peoples opinion of you. Stop trying to convince everyone that youâ€™re a good/interesting person.</p>

<p>If someone is dishonest towards another person, itâ€™s a matter of time before he or she will do the same thing to you.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t be afraid to spend time by yourself, 98% will be boredom, however sometimes (2%) you will get an awesome idea that wouldnâ€™t have come to you otherwise.</p>

<p>If no one believes in your idea or vision, donâ€™t be afraid to press forward by yourself.</p>

<p>Give emotional support to your friends if they need it: take a long walk together, let them vent about their problems, give them your perspective,â€¦</p>

<p>Reading a good book can be one of the best forms of therapy: itâ€™s helpful to realise youâ€™re not the only one facing some kind of problem.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t lie.</p>

<p>Avoid fake people.</p>

<p>Everyone has a faith/religion, if you think you donâ€™t have one, think again. Ask yourself: what is the driving force behind my actions? Seeking pleasure? Money? Recognition from my peers or parents?</p>

<p>Try to build a community of like-minded people around yourself.</p>

<p>A large social circle can be draining and a waste of time; 3-5 good friends are usually more than enough.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t give in to peer pressure.</p>
