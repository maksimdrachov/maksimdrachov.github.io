I"Ô<p>I had a good time. More than ever I needed someone to tell me it would end well, but I realized that this was probably not the case. Sitting alone by myself in my house, I was drinking, trying to forget that soon this party would be over. My life had run its course and the near future looked bleaker than ever. It wasnâ€™t hard to end up in this place, but it would be much harder to escape it. For a good while I was thinking of committing suicide; that seemed like the easier option in my case. The only thing that kept me from actually swallowing the bottle of sleeping pills was the thought of what this would do to my mother. If she heard that I had ended my life, she would not be able to bear this life anymore herself. It wasnâ€™t my fault life had turned out so unbearable, but I still felt responsible to not make the load heavier for the people around me. I was living not for myself, but for the people around me. The small number of people that cared anyway.</p>
